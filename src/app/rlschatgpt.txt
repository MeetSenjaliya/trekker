**Short answer:**
✔️ **Yes — if all RLS tests are passing AND policies are correct AND the client is authenticated, then your page *must* fetch the data.**
If data is still not showing on your UI, **the problem is NOT RLS. It’s somewhere else in the fetching logic or the way the component is mounted.**

---

# ✅ Let me explain clearly

Your RLS test page (`page.tsx`) is performing:

* **SELECT (own data)** → PASS
* **INSERT (own)** → PASS
* **UPDATE (own)** → PASS
* **DELETE (blocked or allowed depending on policy)** → PASS
* **Other-user access** → BLOCKED → PASS

This proves:

# 🎯 Conclusion: **Your policies are perfect. RLS is not blocking anything.**

So if another page is NOT fetching the data, there are only 5 real reasons:

---

# 🔍 **Top 5 Reasons Data Doesn’t Show EVEN When RLS Works**

### **1️⃣ The user is NOT authenticated on that page**

Even if RLS tests show you are logged in, your other page may not have:

```ts
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
```

If `user` is `null`, RLS blocks everything → Empty result.

👉 Check in console:

```js
console.log(await supabase.auth.getUser())
```

---

### **2️⃣ Using server component instead of client component**

Supabase Auth **does not work on the server** unless you pass cookies manually.

If your page is:

```ts
export default async function Page() {} 
```

This is a **server component**, and will ALWAYS get `user = null`.

👉 Convert to:

```ts
'use client'
```

OR use:

```ts
import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server'
```

---

### **3️⃣ Query is missing `.eq('user_id', user.id)`**

RLS allows SELECT but PostgREST might **return empty** if you’re querying incorrectly.

Example mistake:

```ts
const { data } = await supabase.from("favorites").select("*")
```

Correct:

```ts
const { data } = await supabase.from("favorites").select("*").eq("user_id", user.id)
```

---

### **4️⃣ Wrong project credentials (public anon key from another project)**

If the page is using:

```ts
const supabase = createClient('wrong-url', 'wrong-anon-key')
```

Then RLS fails silently → returns empty.

---

### **5️⃣ Next.js cache blocking the request**

If the data does not update:

```ts
fetch("/api/anything", { cache: 'no-store' })
```

or disable caching:

```ts
const { data } = await supabase.from("favorites").select("*", { cache: 'no-store' })
```

---

# ✔️ So YES — If tests pass, data should 100% fetch correctly.

If your other page is still empty, tell me:

👉 **Which page is not showing data?**
👉 **Paste that page’s code**, I will find the exact issue in 2 minutes.

You already solved the hard part (RLS) — now we fix the small page-side issue.
